# solid-vote
This is a prototype code for an Electronic Voting Machine based on ATmega16L.
The hardware consists of two units - Ballot Unit and Control Unit.
The vote is casted using the Ballot unit whereas the Control Unit controls when the vote is to be casted.
For this prototype I have considered only 4 parties which can be increased as per the requirement.
